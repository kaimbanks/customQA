      <div class = "content_section" id = "requirements"> 

        <p> <b>Requirements </b></p>

        <p> Because WashU is such a renowned academic institituion, it stands to reason that we have rigorous transfer requirements. As much as we'd love to admit everybody with a thirst for education, our small student body size inhibits us from doing so. Transfer students must meet the following requirements in order to be eligible: </p>

        <ul id = "req_list"> 
          <li> Cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher </li>
          <li> Official High School Diploma </li>
          <li> At least one completed semester of studies at a recognized college-level academic institution </li>
          <li> Official transcript detailing at least some university-level coursework </li>

        </ul>
